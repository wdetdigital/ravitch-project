# ravitch-project
Documenting digital features produced through <a href="http://wdet.org/ravitch/">WDET's Ravitch Reporting Grant</a>, a special project produced in partnership with the <a href="http://ravitch.journalism.cuny.edu/">Ravitch Fiscal Reporting Program</a> at the <a href="http://www.journalism.cuny.edu/">CUNY Graduate School of Journalism</a> and <a href="http://wdet.org/series/2016-elections-issues-candidates/">WDET's 2016 Elections: Issues & Candidates</a> series.

## Our toolbox
We've used the following tools to build a variety of interactive digital features throughout this series:
- <a href="https://wdet.cartodb.com/me">CartoDB</a> for mapping;
- <a href="http://www.visme.co/">Visme</a> for infographics we can share both through news posts and social media;
- <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> for charting and graphing, with example javascripts in <a href="https://github.com/wdetdigital/2016-delegates">this repo</a>;
- <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-730513779">Soundcloud</a> for managing our 2016 Elections audio files, and <a href="https://soundcite.knightlab.com/">SoundCiteJS</a> for adding short clips throughout news posts;
- Custom HTML/CSS for building quizzes, documented in <a href="https://github.com/wdetdigital/cdbg-match">this repo</a>

## features-table.html
Built to curate and visualize the multi-media content we produced and published leading up to Michigan's 2016 Presidential Primary. This table lives at <a href="http://wdet.org/ravitch/">wdet.org/ravitch</a> - a central place for our readers and funders to learn about the special project and explore related content.

<a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/05/09/responsive-data-tables.html">This NPR Visuals blog</a> was really helpful in thinking through how to make this table more mobile-friendly.

The icons are sourced from the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a>. The radio tower and community images are credited to Daniele Catalanotto and Creative Stall respectively.
