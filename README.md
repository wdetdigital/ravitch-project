# ravitch-project
Documenting digital features produced through WDET's Ravitch Reporting Grant, a special project produced in partnership with the <a href="http://ravitch.journalism.cuny.edu/">Ravitch Fiscal Reporting Program</a> at the <a href="http://www.journalism.cuny.edu/">CUNY Graduate School of Journalism</a>.

## Our toolbox
Outline the tools we've used to map, chart, etc throughout different posts.

## features-table.html
Built to curate and visualize the multi-media content we produced and published leading up to Michigan's 2016 Presidential Primary. This table lives at <a href="http://wdet.org/ravitch/">wdet.org/ravitch</a> - a central place for our readers and funders to learn about the special project and explore related content.

<a href="http://blog.apps.npr.org/2014/05/09/responsive-data-tables.html">This NPR Visuals blog</a> was really helpful in thinking through how to make this table more mobile-friendly.

The icons are sourced from the <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">Noun Project</a>. The radio tower and community images are credited to Daniele Catalanotto and Creative Stall respectively.

## ravitch-credit.html
A simple credit to include at the bottom of any post published through the project.

If you're WDET staff and need to mark a post with this credit, switch the post text editor to Source, then copy/paste everything between the `<style>...</style>` and `<div>...</div>` tags one line below your content.
